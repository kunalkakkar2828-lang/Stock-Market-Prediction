"""
Author: Madhurima Rawat

Script to clean a Streamlit app by removing all top-level functions except 'main'.
Preserves:
- All import statements
- Global variables
- Top-level code (outside functions)
- The 'main' function (if present)

Removes both the function and the comment immediately above it.

Saves the result as 'app_cleaned.py'.
