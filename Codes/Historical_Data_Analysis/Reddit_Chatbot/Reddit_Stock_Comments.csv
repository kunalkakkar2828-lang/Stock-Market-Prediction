"Sell off us treasury bonds held by China, do an export ban on key rare earth materials to the usa, ban imports of US agricultural porducts(mainly soybeans, corn, pork).

Watch the utter chaos that will happen in the usa.

They probably don't even need to even actually sell their bonds, just start saying they will be selling them all in the coming weeks and months, then sit back and watch the market panic. Then as the market starts to change, the fed would have to do some QE which would cause other problems. Meanwhile China still keeps all their bonds which protects them from the main problem of them trying to sell them off and tanking their value as they try to sell them all."
Make no mistake about it Trump will use this ordeal with China (which he intentionally started) as an excuse to strengthen trade and support with Russa.
You’re making the case that Americans should be taking advantage of slave labor wages in other countries? Sounds pretty horrible to me
"Yeah that's the thing, but what happens to us along the way. Markets can't continue trading the way they are. Something is going to lock up. Someone is going to blow up. 

I was doing the math on this and to have that outsized negative effect on China it's almost like a nuclear war where no one wins. We could cause China a lot of pain but our markets and our employment rate and our people are going to suffer dearly. It's absolutely idiotic because realistic trade agreements could easily be made but that could have happened from the beginning. They could have singled out country by country by country and just went down the line making agreements. Destabilizing the global economy served absolutely no purpose and if anything it hurt The credibility of the United States"
"Maybe genociding part of their population? Or is that OK even though it has cost more lives? The US has done some bad shit and they’re not the good guy, but China is not better, they’re just acting like an adult while the US acts like a preschooler."
Which is strange because they already where that in his first turn. They are just much more illegal about it this time.

"I remember back in 2010, my high school biology teacher talked about how us American students were so behind compared to international students. He would show us John Stossel dumb in America documentary like 20 times. Because us dumb high school students who slack off and skip class are competing with all other high school students in the world, notably Chinese students who are hyper competitive and vastly outnumber us. So I'm guessing this reality is coming into fruition, leaving Americans in the dust."

"Oh, you're misunderstanding me, they wouldn't willingly tank the market. 
And I agree with you.  What I'm saying is, currently, the minority party is not using the power it possesses to  properly react to what is happening.


When Republicans were the minority party they filibustered and halted every nomination Obama had. To the extent that many of them could not get through before the next president. Mitch McConnell pulled off some insane stuff.
Dems have the same tools in their tool belt they just aren't using them.


I think they've been especially bad lately with their messaging.  
Have you seen Kamala or Biden at any of the protests? Why did only one senator stand up when Trump was giving his State of the Union? 

Why is there not a bigger stink being made right now? Why are outsiders like Bernie, AOC, and Booker the only ones doing anything."
TSMC would not pay anything under any tariffs that the Cheeto man can impose.  Will someone please explain this to hm.
"No evidence of Chinese dumping right? Another article I read mentioned that it's various hedge funds, and unlikely to be the Chinese."
"I think the fundamental problem that mightve been missed is that countries with good relations with US actually have low to 0 tariffs on US, yet they got slapped with tariffs by trump for no reason. Trumps billboard was rather misleading in that the way the administration measured ""tariffs"" from other nations was fundamentally wrong - you cant take the trade deficit divided by the imports to get that number, that isn't tariffs at all. A good analogy I read is that its like trying to measure your body temperature based on your foreheads distance from the sun - totally unrelated and doesn't help you at all"

I don't think there is any getting back to where you were on the world stage and I honestly think this is the beginning of the US's slow decline against the EU and BRIC countries. It won't be fast, but trump has destroyed the US's place as THE world's superpower"
"You really don’t get it. We as a nation cant make anything. The pandemic taught us that. Well guess what, you have Russia invading Europe and there or officially North Korean troops on the battle field. The Ukrainians have recently captured Chinese soldiers.

"They’ll be radical until they lose their jobs and prices rise. Of course some will be so tribal and lacking in critical thought that they’ll back him regardless. 

But in terms of people who vote - there will be a lot who realise the emperor has no clothes. And they will be worried. All they need to do is not vote for Trump vs actually vote for Dems. 

Despite what he thinks, Donald can’t tell the markets or the economy what to do. 

He has, to be fair, defied political gravity. But he can’t defy economic gravity, which is what he’s trying to do."
"Dems haven't done shit even when they had power. If they'd actually *done something* then they'd probably still be in power. 

The GOP can blow a multi-trillion dollar hold in the national debt with their 2017 tax bill, but Dems can't even get a $15 minimum wage passed because the parliamentarian said it wasn't revenue-neutral.

What about Medicare for all? ""Too expensive."" Actually, it's not, but even if it were, why is it that the right wing can spend all the money they want on stupid shit but we can't get basic necessities? 

What about statehood for PR and DC? That would have secured the Senate (probably the House too) for Dems right now. ""Oops forgot to get to that."" 

I'm not saying that anyone should have voted for Republicans. Ever. But I *am* saying that if the Dems did something real and tangible for people - not just abstract window dressing far removed from people's wages and bank balances - they would forever be in power."
Trump canceled tariffs in his first term and granted exemptions to companies. It will happen again.
He doesn't have a mind to lose.
Invasion of Taiwan has been scheduled for fall of 2027 or Spring of 2028 since Xi announced it to the world a couple years ago. No idea what you're talking about 20-30 years away.

China has no labor laws.  they basically can hire indentured servants to do the work in often dangerous conditions for little pay.  shit people try to jump out windows to their die it it so bad.  we don't want that here but seems that is what trump wants to do to American

the more depressed people are financially they will work any job just to eat

not like a big reason to do this.  I could understand if we were doing poorly and being really cheated to the point of financial collapse but we are a top nation financially in the world.  we are envied for our arts and entertainment, technology, freedom.  why f that up"

">You can never have to many jobs. Labor shortages are a myth, you just drive wage growth and improved productivity

There can only ever be as many jobs as there are labor hours to work them.

> It'd still be nice if everything here wasn't entirely disrupted by an event out of our control half way around the world.

That's gonna happen regardless. Even if we went total autarky and traded with no one, eventually trouble would come knocking. When it does we'll be poorer and less prepared than we would have otherwise.

Chips from Tawain are one thing. Until about 2 months ago, our supply of aluminum from Canada would not actually have been in threat, even in case of like ww3.

> I'll take any tax that results in wage growth, which this will

Unless increased prices cause a drop in demand for goods and services, which translates into decreased demand for labor, which then results in pay freezes and layoffs. 

Especially when factoring in retaliatory tariffs from other countries.

>Think of it another way, it's trickle down economics again. Are you personally importing things from overseas? No a company is. Do they drop prices every time they move a job overseas? No, the companies keep the profits and your out of a job. Everyone is so worried about the tariffs trickling down, but the profit from overseas labor never have.

Imported goods lead directly to lower costs for consumers, otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation in the first place. If domestically produced t-shirts offered consumers the same value per dollar as imports, then a mild and generic ""buy American"" bias would lead to people consistently chosing American made t-shirts over imported t-shirts."

"My opinion:
If you aren’t planning on pulling any investments out anytime soon, then take advantage of this declining market. Wait for 5-10 years and watch as your amount goes back to its typical upward trend ( S&P or blue chips, I use vanguard). I allow myself to invest so much each month with my paycheck, 20%. I split this between gold, and blue chips, and I t try to always have at least one rental, but when there are downward trends, the gut check reaction is to sale. Ignore that, instead buy more and wait it out. It will correct, it almost ALWAYS corrects. I would stay away from stocks for specific companies unless you feel very confident that they are going in a successful direction. 

Everybody is stressing, and for good reason, but if you have got time, don’t miss this opportunity to get some money at a discount."
"You underestimate my diamond hands.

Xi needs to talk to more people before announcing his retaliation than Trump needs to announce the first tarrif. At this point I wonder why don't Taiwan just unite with China? (A rhetoric question. I'm from Taiwan btw)

"What a complete lack of understanding of Chinese culture and politics. The CCPs control is of course largely absolute, but dissent tended to spring up around liberalized Nuevo riche benefiting from the prosperity of Chinas hybrid open market. What they've done is what they also just did in Canada - handed anyone opposing Trump and his agenda a blank check from the bank of public will.

This is foreign barbarians and colonialism all over again. This is everything they had a revolution over. The party had authority, now they'll have genuine patriotic fervor. Combine that with the Chinese concept of face which more or less makes it IMPOSSIBLE for the government to back down, and their willingness and ability to sacrifice human lives for the great patriotic struggle.

Worse still, China backed into a corner, may lash out at Taiwan and then you have a horrible catastrophe of human death. Taiwans defense plan - and America's plans revolving around China for that matter if armed conflict ever happened - are probably best described as warcrimes as the doctrine involves obliterating their infrastructure with long range missiles and destroying their dams. The civilian death toll would be catastrophic. There's a reason China hasn't invaded Taiwan yet, and it was always their inability to blitz them navally and America's backing. Now we can't be sure if Taiwan even had that backing, and China may act if it feels its ride or die."

"Unfortunately produce and meat will probably fall in price. Same with other in country made items. Unless farmers start defaulting on their loans.

"What’s hilarious is that for all their Project2025 shit, they’re going to end up ruling an ostracized, economic wasteland. Bravo!"
"Because while their are capitalist they also rely on ideology. Money matters, but ideology and perception matters more for them."
The markets and our position in the world both really need something to happen soon. Unfortunately I do not think congress will exercise its authority this week or even next week. Mike Johnson said today (now yesterday) that he is not willing to check Donald Trump on this.
I mean if companies are on 4% margins net and 25% tariffs come on their cost of production... how much do you think they can absorb and how much gets passed on to consumer? Inflation is almost certain to go up and rapidly so. There are very very few companies that can see cost of production go up 25/50% and not increase prices. He'll even msft which is majority services is at 30% margin. So if they absorb some of the cost of their physical goods made in China their overall margins will tank is they absorb or inflation rockets if they don't. There is not a single positive out of this. Lower sales due to higher prices or margin crush because prices stayed the same. Nobody in the news talking bout this.
Hope is all I have left. Don't take it away from me.

"It has been rational in my opinion - the underlying theme is that the economy is strong, but the Trump administration is considering policies that will break it. So any news that cast doubts on whether he’ll go along with the tariffs or any news for potential deals move the markets up, while any news that point towards the tariffs actually happening move the market down. It will swing up and down until we know for sure if this is happening (and if it does it will be a bloodbath)."

"Hypothetically, if China forced the closure of Apple manufacturing in China, then Apple's business would clearly be seriously compromised.  It would take time to relocate manufacturing back to the US, or more likely moved to existing plants in India and Vietnam etc.

But, there would be a plus. Many people, who don't buy Apple precisely because they are made in China, may be persuaded to buy Apple in the future if they pulled out, or were forced out of China."

Who could have guessed Trump could get outplayed by another country... I mean besides all the experts and people with common sense.
He targeted those his first term too. The only difference is that now he runs amok mostly unchecked with support from the other branches.
"I don’t think people are understanding that it’s not about “China enduring” that’s the problem, it’s that China needs to consume. 

The US is a fat pig that is about to go on a detox to get fit again - this the US can do. China, on the other hand, now has to gorge itself with a large amount of food the US is about to leave behind. China has been trying to improve domestic consumption for over a decade with very little results. 

China has lowered their interest rates, given out bad loans, doubled & tripled down on those loans, injected liquidity…and yet the average Chinese citizen would rather put their money under the mattress and live pragmatically.

If China can’t offload their products domestically, internationally will prove really hard considering nations willing to negotiate with the US more and the EU being reluctant to take on more Chinese imports."
"Guess China doesn't need to respond immediately, when actions will suffice"
"My focus now is quite simple. Set some price points to dca back in. If the market switches to a bull run and rallies back to ATH I'm back in the green regardless of putting anything back in.

Just less green, however playing this way my majority cash is safe if we do indeed head downward. Can bring my average down in the process."
True. And our government is now taxing its citizens 104% to control the means of production so call that communism if you want as well
"Man that was actually a good read I'll give you that (only read PIIE, don't have time for the other we all know income inequality has grown and wages haven't gone up).

What you said does follow. You literally copy and pasted the findings of the study lol (or maybe copied it from AI, it's okay I don't blame you). Here's my personal take far more than just blindly following (copy & pasting) what it/AI tells me.

1. This study and its assumptions are relative to the US and Chinese (as that study heavily references) economies in 2010 which btw, is not 2005 like you suggested. The state of the US/ World economies and our trade dynamics are soooo different from what they were back then. Just that fact alone makes the assumed outcomes of this study way less viable.
2. There's a lot we can get into here but I'll share a few things that come to mind, I'll keep it simple: - Foreign debt, we have a ton of foreign debt way more than back then... what will a weaker dollar do? Increase cost of servicing that debt and could lead to making it even harder to manage. - You referenced this: *""10% depreciation of the dollar could reduce the U.S. current account deficit by 1.4% of GDP over three years""* with most improvements in the trade balance coming from increased exports. This study assumes increased exports will be backed by manual ""traditional"" manufacturing. Technology's gotten better and scarier and if we were going back to manual manufacturing then weakening the dollar, in this regard, maybe makes sense but manual traditional manufacturing is not coming back. Not in today's world.

My biggest takeaway from this is NO ONE knows how to put the pieces together to fix this mess, so in a way I guess just try whatever at this point. Either way we're all fucked."
"	Actually, that’s not how it works. U.S. food exports make up only about 2.1% of China’s total food imports. China sources food from a wide range of countries including Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and Russia. Losing U.S. supply wouldn’t “skyrocket” prices in the way you’re suggesting.

Also, China has one of the world’s largest agricultural sectors and maintains massive grain reserves. They’ve built resilience into their food supply chain specifically to withstand trade disruptions.

As for the claim about currency devaluation — yes, devaluation can make imports pricier, but it also boosts exports and helps offset tariffs. It’s not a “last resort,” it’s a common strategic tool in international trade.

And let’s not even compare modern China to the Great Famine — that was a tragic and very different historical context, driven by Mao-era policies. Xi’s leadership, while certainly controversial, operates in a radically different global and domestic environment.

American are so illiterate, no wonder you guys don’t learn."

"I’m a doctor, what a lot of people don’t realise is that he’s essentially cut off the supply of HIV therapy to hundreds of millions of people…what happens when people don’t get their HIV meds and then restart them some undisclosed time later? A) their HIV comes back, B) it develops resistance to the previous meds…you can add multi drug resistant HIV/AIDS spreading around the world to your Trump is a fucktard bingo list. Many Americans don’t care but they will when he tarrifs pharma as well."

I'm skipping over some of your market stuff, as there's going to be a lot of "" what ifs"". He did fine.

Take the infrastructure bill, he could have dedicated some of that to high speed rail systems like every other first world country has. But they want to keep infrastructure car based. He dedicated 500 billion to this, then gave 175 billion to Israel. to bomb children in Gaza. 


Progressives open tiktok, they see their tax dollars paying to bomb 5-year-old girl in Gaza. They see the New York mayor signing bombs. When they make a stink about this the government bans the app. 


At the end of the day, millions of Americans were dissatisfied with both parties and sat out the election.

"I think your post actually represents the average American 

Truthfully we have never had a situation like this before. We can look at historical technicals for drawdowns but the tariffs have to be removed. If they aren't we're going into some type of scenario no one wants to be in. Congress would act before that happened but you also could be in a 50% market drawdown when Congress does act 

I don't really know how this plays out because I was expecting Trump to just bully people, be his normal asshole self, work some deals, play golf and chant to his Red hats. What he's doing is not even logical 

Even his own people are seeing it I'm not sure how he really comes back from this if he doesn't start announcing deals and trade and so on and so forth in the next few days. People are going to be calling their congressman before long. probably already are. We have no idea what is happening behind the scenes did we do know Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are all over TV talking about what a ridiculous idea this is. They are strong enough to do that. We don't know how many more Junior Republican people in Congress are calling and saying I will support you if you have the numbers. The thing is if Congress has to take away Trump's tariff toy, his presidency will be permanently shattered. It would be the same as watching him get beat up like his ego would never recover. Maybe he would resign? Like you just don't know"

Trump is not concerned currently because he is printing billions. Literally siphoning bribes from the billionaires, common folks and other countries. In the off event that he allows future election to take place and loses, he will seek sanctuary in Russia with 100 billion instead.

"You’re 38. Time horizon is long. It’s a good time to reexamine why you’re invested in the first place. If you’re invested for a quick profit or for next year, visibility is uncertain. If you’re invested for the long term, your best bet is to really understand and manage long term risk. There are several stocks I’ve sold because I don’t have a firm grasp on long term risk. That doesn’t mean I don’t know what it will do tomorrow or next week, or even this year. It means my speculative appetite is no longer as robust in that particular stock, especially with other options. 

As for “blow up the entire financial system”, take a deep breath. World war 2 couldn’t bring down the stock market. Neither could the Cuban missile crisis. Not 9/11 or the financial crisis of 2008. The American capitalist system, with all its flaws has still been the best system for innovation, corporate growth and wealth creation. 

My suspicion is your personal biases and having a myopic view of short-termism are exacerbating these feelings. It’s normal. Many people feel this way. However as an investor, your job is to understand yourself, your goals, the risks presented to you to your best ability and make sound decisions that reflect the goals for your future self. Your job isn’t to react to headlines, make the most profits tomorrow or dodge some unknown shock to the markets. Nobody can do that."

"How would this affect the dollar? I guess it would make it cheaper?

Usually the dollars get converted to bonds, and the huge demand for US bonds allows the US to print a lot of dollars without creating an oversupply of dollars. But if the bonds demand drops, there is no place for dollars to go, and they would kind of pile up, without meeting a demand for them?

Am I thinking about this correctly?"
I have not - what's the song?

"The US will lose way more than China with tariffs. They are not going to lose face publicly either so insulting them or threatening them just makes a negotiation less likely.

"EddyElfenbein to explain what really happened on Monday. My oh my. 


"" On Monday, the stock market had an especially volatile morning. In just eight minutes, the S&P 500 rallied 5.66%. It then promptly lost 4.37% over the next seven minutes. We’re talking about several trillion dollars magically appearing and disappearing during less time than a lunchbreak.


What happened? Well, that’s a good question. It appears that Kevin Hassett, the Director of the National Economic Council, was being interview on Fox News. During the interview he was asked if the president was considering a 90-day pause for his tariff policies. Hassett clearly gave a non-committal answer (“the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.”)


Somehow someone on Twitter took that for a yes and tweeted it out. That was from a small account (less than 1,000 followers), but soon a much larger account known as “Walter Bloomberg” reposted it, and suddenly, this was taken as serious news on Wall Street.


I should add that Walter Bloomberg is not connected with Bloomberg, the financial news service. His tweet came out at 10:11 am and by 10:12 am, CNN reported that cheers erupted on the floor of the NYSE. I guess that’s a good barometer of how unpopular the tariffs are on Wall Street.


At CNBC, the anchors were completely baffled by the market’s surge and by 10:15 am, they were reporting on the news. Soon Reuters was referencing CNBC but they were only going on what Twitter was saying. Soon people were referencing people who were referencing people who were just making things up."""

"While trump is expanding his power in unprecedented ways, this isn't exactly that. Presidents have mostly had pretty wide power to enact tariffs. But, while this was just Trump, it really wasn't, because Congress can stop him and they aren't. So he is implicitly being backed by Congress."

Alright, alright, settle down, settle down, you beautiful people! Believe me, you are beautiful. The best people. And you know it.

The fake news is out there, they're saying Nero, this great emperor – one of the greatest, frankly, maybe the greatest – they're saying he, uh, might have had something to do with the… the little bonfire we had the other night. A little… spontaneous combustion, you could call it. Very unfortunate. Very, very sad.

But let me tell you, these are losers. These are the same people who said my lyre playing was… not the best. Can you believe it? The most beautiful music, folks. Tremendous music. Everyone agrees.

And this fire? Let me tell you, it was a disaster, a terrible, terrible thing. But you know what? Sometimes, you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet. A big, beautiful omelet. And that’s what we’re doing here in Rome. We’re making it great again!

This old city? Frankly, it was a mess. Dilapidated. Sad. Falling apart. The buildings? Believe me, they were no good. Crooked. Weak. Not the best materials. We needed something better. Something stronger. Something… modern.

And now? Now we have a clean slate. A beautiful opportunity. We’re going to rebuild Rome, bigger and better than ever before. The most magnificent city the world has ever seen. Palaces, folks, you wouldn’t believe. Colosseums that will make your head spin. Everything will be the best. The absolute best.

They say I was playing the fiddle, right? The… the violin. A beautiful instrument. And you know what? Sometimes, when you have a vision, a tremendous vision for the future, you need a little… inspiration. A little music to get the creative juices flowing. It’s called art, folks. You wouldn’t understand.

And these… these Christians they’re blaming? Honestly, they’re probably the ones who started it! Very nasty people. Believe me. They’re always causing trouble. We’ll look into it. We’ll get to the bottom of it. The best investigators, the best.
So, don’t listen to the haters. Don’t listen to the fake news.

 This fire, while a tragedy, is also an opportunity. An opportunity to build something truly spectacular. Something that will be the envy of the entire world.

We are going to make Rome great again! Believe me. It’s going to be tremendous. The best Rome. You’ll see. Thank you, and God bless Rome! And God bless me! You deserve it!"

You can't just not collect that tax revenue. It has to come from another source. That source will be tariffs and a national sales tax. This means low income families *who need to buy things to survive* will actually pay MORE in taxes than with the current progressive tax system. 

So no, that will not have a positive impact on the US economy. It will even FURTHER reduce the average American's spending power, and it will discourage spending in general, which will then slow down the economy."

"Look, NVDA is a super valuable company with a high likelihood to recover long-term term (my perspective). It's not just a hype company. 

What you need to keep in mind is that you shall only put money in this type of investment if you do not need the money in the short term. This will prevent you from selling at a loss. Do not sell and wait for the market recovery (it will take time). What is happening to NVDIA is not a reflection of bad management or bad business. It's just a reflection of Trump's tariffs - external factors. It will likely recover when the market recovers. 

Even if the markets would be high, if you invest in stocks and leave it there for a short term only, your returns probably won't be that significative.  

This is a long-term game to play. Investing in stocks specifically - more volatile - also requires a bit of stomach. It will go up, it will go down, etc. It's also less diversified, and thus the risks are higher. Consider in the future if this is the right investment for your risk tolerance or not. 

Anyway, my thinking is: 
Unless you desperately need this money right now, there's no reason whatsoever for you to panic and sell for NVIDIA specific case, losing part of your money. Be patient and wait. 

P.S. 
I bought NVDIA last Monday when it was super low, only thing green in my portfolio. I'm considering buying even more this week."

I think Dems will be too weak to do anything unless a dark horse wins. Look at how they handled Tim Walz as a vp pick. He got picked because of his tv interviews. Those called him to go up.

"In my opinion it’s very rational. Everyone immediately shorts, the counterparties are market makers like citadel. 

They see that it only takes a “little bit” to start a cascading liquidation so they tip the domino. They short squeeze retail and the price skyrockets temporarily. 

Once all of the “high risk” shorts have been cleared they use the upward momentum to lull retail into buying as the market makers “short” discretely. The price eventually crashes, retail is left holding the bag, then they rinse and repeat."
It’s more that their leveraged positions are at risk of high interest due to high IV which can induce a short squeeze. They need cash to close positions.
"I know.  we are okay with some tariffs.  not like tariffs are a new thing.  but nothing like this has ever happened.  90 countries in a month.  the only large tariffs comparable led into the great depression. 

this was not calculated based on the type of goods, the country etc. was just some haphazard numbers based on very very lazy math.  no economists were involved to figure out what numbers make sense what what and where.

a good example is coffee, chocolate and bananas.  why have tariffs on produce we have no ability to produce in our own country?  we have to import them.  we are simply making them more expensive for no reason.  those countries barely import anything from us since they don't have money to buy anything

lumber is another good example.  if you loo at housing becoming excessively expensive it started in 2017 when he put tariffs on Candanian lumber.  but why?  we don't product enough lumber and have no desire or plans to.  are we going to produce enough lumber here?  no way.  we are just going to pay more.

there are many things we can strategically do to negotiate with countries.  we are not doing that.  everyone is just making plans to avoid the US.  they hate Trump and many countries simply laughed at hi, as they know it will damage the US more than them."
"It’s not empathy, it’s not wanting to believe it could get so bad, and it’s the uncertainty of what Trump is doing everyone is assuming this trade war will somehow be averted but what if it doesn’t and then in the next News cycle it starts over the shits crazy"

"Copy paste of my own comment lol

Ima try my best.

People are saying ""China dumping US treasuries,"" -not yet confirmed is China but just pure speculation due to tariffs situation- they mean that China is selling off its holdings of US government bonds, known as treasuries. These bonds are a way for the US government to borrow money, and China has been one of the largest buyers of them for many years.

Now, this could lead to an increase in US interest rates, as the US would need to offer higher rates to attract new buyers for the bonds. It could also affect global markets, as US treasuries are considered one of the safest investments -idk about that as of right now-.

FYI bonds is basically when a country needs funds for whatever reason -schools, building roads, etc- it borrows money from people or this case, a country. They get the money upfront and then they return it later with a little extra as interest for letting them borrow.

Aight, this just means China -speculative- is putting less money or lending less money to the US as of right now, which leads to what's happening currently, yields are going up -this is like the interest rate you earn on bonds. When lots of people buy bonds, their price goes up, and the yield (interest rate) goes down.- even though stock markets are going down. Normally, you'd expect the yield to go down when the market crashes because people would be buying bonds for safety. But if the yield is going up while the stock market down, it suggests that people are losing confidence in US treasury bonds causing the US would struggle to borrow money, interest rates could skyrocket, and it would likely make the economy much worse than during the 2008 financial crisis. 

Tldr; we're fucked, bye now ima jump off a building, peace out✌️"

"Just curious, has Donald trump disrupting the entire world order and setting the US up to be a global pariah made life for you more difficult as a US citizen? Especially since you’re living in the country where he seems to have mainly focused his tariff sights on."
Honestly? They've created a monster that they can't control at this point.
"It's gotta happen, right? Like I get that there's a few that really are just dumb and follow Trump the same way the average MAGA does. But most of them are not stupid. A little evil, a little conniving, but they aren't stupid or incompetent - they usually are pretty good at what they're doing. I feel the 25th or a successful impeachment & removal is inevitable unless Trump has them all hostage to something we don't know about."

"The infighting has begun in earnest. The different factions within the GOP know Trump has overplayed his hand and are  smelling blood in the water. 

Hardline fiscal hawks are balking at his requested budget, the 1 trillion in new spending for the military, and the lack of progress toward the 1.5 - 2.0 trillion in deficit cuts (primarily entitlements) he promised during his campaign.

Trump doesn't have the votes within the GOP for his plan and won't be able to go to the Democrats for votes to make up the difference. The economic pain just gives these other factions more leverage over Trump.

If Congress breaks for their two week recess without a vote on his plan, you will know Trump's goose is cooked."
"Good luck finding let's say white Eastern or South Europeans willing to work for such low prices. Even Belarus has better working conditions.

Donald, it's not 1950s anymore. Conditions in Europe (and half of the world) has changed and improved.

"Doesn't invalidate my point.  Especially since Russia does not have Tariffs on US goods, like other countries do.  Also add the fact they are negotiating a peace deal on the Ukraine war.  So a lot more moving factors with Russia vs other countries.

$400 might be exaggerated numbers but $8000 seems also excessive. 

You are missing the point of the original comment and nitpicking the details by using misleading figures. The point is that people do not have sufficient emergency funds, whether it’s $400 or $2k, or even $8k. Normal people will suffer due to the tariffs regardless."

"> outsource it to specialists. Why would you go back to the old system?

Because the owners of the specialists are asking for ransom. And there is no way EU cannot create products that satisfy their needs. 

The global trade is gone anyway. Imagine working with Russian cloud company. They can ask for ransom citing ""unfair"" deals made in the past. 

Now with tarrifs, because the products of each country is protected by tariffs. First priority will be to secure the business stability from external factors. 

 Like if France tariffs AWS 25%, then the reasons like ""specialists, cost, speed"" goes out of the window. Plus, it will provide more jobs to the Europeans."
"A global 0% tariff system isn't feasible due to several economic and political realities:

- **Sovereign interests**: Countries use tariffs to protect domestic industries, jobs, and strategic sectors from foreign competition. Removing all tariffs removes that control.

- **Revenue loss**: Many developing nations rely on tariffs as a key source of government income. Eliminating them would create budget shortfalls.

- **Trade imbalances**: Without tariffs, wealthier nations with more efficient industries could flood markets in weaker economies, worsening inequality and dependence.

- **Lack of enforcement mechanisms**: There’s no global authority to enforce universal 0% tariffs or resolve resulting disputes fairly for all parties.

- **Political resistance**: Tariff elimination would face heavy opposition from industries, unions, and voters affected by increased foreign competition.

In short, while 0% tariffs might sound ideal in theory (free trade, lower costs), in practice, the world’s economic disparities, political interests, and sovereignty concerns make it unworkable."
"There is a difference in the complexity of a 1940 supply chain producing tanks from that era, and 2025 complexity of TVs, smartphones and so on. Not just the factories, the expertise needed by people to construct / operate it.

"They put the minimum tariff rate on those islands, so if countries did want to exploit that loophole, as long as they're being tariffed higher, they could still benefit from that. So it makes zero since as a deterrent, unless they made those island's tariff rate 100% or something intentionally high. But all that is moot. Those islands are remote as fuck, and simply passing something through a port doesn't change its origin of export. It would look super suspicious if a random uninhabited island started exporting millions of dollars worth of product to the US. Amd I really doubt companies are going to start building factories on remote sub-antarctic islands just to circumvent a tariff."
I am very worried about tomorrow :(
I mean it's close to certain Roman emperors.

Bro. The problem is the sourcing hell that's to come. The US needs truff to keep functioning. And the competitive position of China is just bust.

"Which is more likely, that Democrats have been conning their own voters (which would majorly bite them in the ass if it ever came out) in order to elect someone to implement tariffs so they can sell at the correct time to make money, or Democrats lost an election by a margin they didn't expect, are having some trouble figuring out a new message without a central leader, and some Democrats, knowing what tariffs will do to the economy, sold early to lock in their gains like anyone would? Here's a hint: it's the second one."

"Bc the global market is panicking and would rather hold cash than US debt no matter how safe it is historically. People are dumping bonds, creating a supply against low institutional demand and the result is higher yields. A $1000 Tnote sold for $950 has a higher yield than that same note sold for $1050 given the same base rate. 

In short, there’s a complete lack of trust by anyone serious to hold onto US assets vs cash given that cash can be moved at a moments notice and bonds cannot (liquidity).

Ie. Holding T notes isn’t even worth it because there may be no buyers for them in the future (money parked in other markets instead)/the US defaults (cannot pay the interest on the notes or the notes themselves at maturity)."
"The thing is... if this was done ten years ago, it mightve been succesful. But today, China became too big and diversed.

"Tariffs pull money out of circulation—they are, by definition, a deflationary financial tool.

As for your second point, your cost analysis is wrong, but I’ll get to that in a second... When there’s no demand, supply builds up. Prices then fall until the excess inventory starts moving. Manufacturers, seeing the decline in demand, reduce supply so it aligns with the new reality. Right now, companies are still ordering based on pre-tariff demand, which means we’re going to see an oversupply. Products will sit on shelves, prices will fall, and companies will sell at a loss if necessary—because recovering 50% is better than 5%.

Over the past 20 years, people bought into the idea that profits only go up. That worked because demand wasn’t being priced out. People still buy Starbucks despite a 400% price increase in the last decade. Companies raise prices until demand drops. That’s why food, groceries, and luxury goods have become so expensive. But let’s be clear—Starbucks could still sell a coffee for under $1 and profit. Yes, there’s a lower limit to how far prices can fall, but it’s far below what we’ve seen in recent years. And when the money supply contracts, the dollar strengthens, meaning your money goes further—driving prices down even more.

So why is this a problem? Because falling prices mean shrinking profits. Companies cut costs to compensate, which means layoffs. People lose jobs, homes, and spending power. That further reduces demand and increases unemployment, creating a downward spiral.

Anyone saying tariffs will raise prices in the long run doesn’t understand economics. Short-term, while employment is still stable, prices might spike. But give it six months—everything will change. If these tariffs persist that long, the bigger threat is global: we risk unseating the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. As the dollar strengthens, other currencies weaken—unless those countries also deflate their currency, which they can’t match at the same scale. Their only move is to stop trading in dollars, which is where the U.S. gets its power.

So in terms of cost: prices are going down. That’s the reality. The idea that tariffs will drive long-term inflation is fundamentally flawed."

"What's the goal you ask? Isn't it obvious?

He is a puppet of Putin directly or indirectly. 

All that is true.

But that doesn’t make China and their one sided trade deals any better. They pretty much target countries that need bail out, infuse a bunch of money into their infrastructure and knowing that they can’t pay back, cut a deal with them to own part of their land and future revenues from them.

Look what they have done in Pakistan, Srilanka and Maldives. 

They also claim entire South China Sea as theirs, encroaching into other sovereign countries and reject ICC claims etc.

Just because Trump is an idiotic traitor doesn’t mean that China’s power needs to be checked to keep their influence over other nations that are Western allies."

"First, the stock market was already overvalued even before the beginning of this.

Secondly, that $450 billion is the amount being lost per year, not just a one time loss. Stocks reflect the expectation of what it will be worth in the future, not just the next year.

Third, the tariffs are being imposed on basically every country not just China.

Fourth, there are a ton of side effects. People are going to lose their jobs, those people that lose their jobs are going to stop buying things, if people stop buying things then companies will start to go out of business, if companies go out of business then even more people will start losing their jobs and it can create a feedback loop that gets worse and worse.. and considering the general incompetence of this administration, people don't have confidence in this administration to deal with that kind of crisis.

Fifth, there are also all of the things being lost in terms of foreign relations. Countries are making moves to drop the US as the world's reserve currency, or at the very least to reduce their dependence on it. If that happens, the US debt problem (which was already very bad to start with) is going to get even worse, which can cause a lot of really bad things to happen in the future, and they're trying to get ahead of that. Not to mention other problems like boycotts against US products in other countries and people refusing to travel to the USA etc.."
