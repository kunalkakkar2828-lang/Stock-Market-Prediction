What you said does follow You literally copy and pasted the findings of the study lol or maybe copied it from AI its okay I dont blame you Heres my personal take far more than just blindly following copy  pasting what itAI tells me

 This study and its assumptions are relative to the US and Chinese as that study heavily references economies in  which btw is not  like you suggested The state of the US World economies and our trade dynamics are soooo different from what they were back then Just that fact alone makes the assumed outcomes of this study way less viable
 Theres a lot we can get into here but Ill share a few things that come to mind Ill keep it simple  Foreign debt we have a ton of foreign debt way more than back then what will a weaker dollar do Increase cost of servicing that debt and could lead to making it even harder to manage  You referenced this  depreciation of the dollar could reduce the US current account deficit by  of GDP over three years with most improvements in the trade balance coming from increased exports This study assumes increased exports will be backed by manual traditional manufacturing Technologys gotten better and scarier and if we were going back to manual manufacturing then weakening the dollar in this regard maybe makes sense but manual traditional manufacturing is not coming back Not in todays world

Also China has one of the worlds largest agricultural sectors and maintains massive grain reserves Theyve built resilience into their food supply chain specifically to withstand trade disruptions

As for the claim about currency devaluation  yes devaluation can make imports pricier but it also boosts exports and helps offset tariffs Its not a last resort its a common strategic tool in international trade

"EddyElfenbein to explain what really happened on Monday My oh my 


 On Monday the stock market had an especially volatile morning In just eight minutes the SP  rallied  It then promptly lost  over the next seven minutes Were talking about several trillion dollars magically appearing and disappearing during less time than a lunchbreak


What happened Well thats a good question It appears that Kevin Hassett the Director of the National Economic Council was being interview on Fox News During the interview he was asked if the president was considering a day pause for his tariff policies Hassett clearly gave a noncommittal answer the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide


Somehow someone on Twitter took that for a yes and tweeted it out That was from a small account less than  followers but soon a much larger account known as Walter Bloomberg reposted it and suddenly this was taken as serious news on Wall Street


I should add that Walter Bloomberg is not connected with Bloomberg the financial news service His tweet came out at  am and by  am CNN reported that cheers erupted on the floor of the NYSE I guess thats a good barometer of how unpopular the tariffs are on Wall Street


At CNBC the anchors were completely baffled by the markets surge and by  am they were reporting on the news Soon Reuters was referencing CNBC but they were only going on what Twitter was saying Soon people were referencing people who were referencing people who were just making things up",0.08796296296296297,260,Other

What you need to keep in mind is that you shall only put money in this type of investment if you do not need the money in the short term This will prevent you from selling at a loss Do not sell and wait for the market recovery it will take time What is happening to NVDIA is not a reflection of bad management or bad business Its just a reflection of Trumps tariffs  external factors It will likely recover when the market recovers 

Even if the markets would be high if you invest in stocks and leave it there for a short term only your returns probably wont be that significative  

This is a longterm game to play Investing in stocks specifically  more volatile  also requires a bit of stomach It will go up it will go down etc Its also less diversified and thus the risks are higher Consider in the future if this is the right investment for your risk tolerance or not 

Anyway my thinking is 
Unless you desperately need this money right now theres no reason whatsoever for you to panic and sell for NVIDIA specific case losing part of your money Be patient and wait

Ima try my best

People are saying China dumping US treasuries not yet confirmed is China but just pure speculation due to tariffs situation they mean that China is selling off its holdings of US government bonds known as treasuries These bonds are a way for the US government to borrow money and China has been one of the largest buyers of them for many years

Now this could lead to an increase in US interest rates as the US would need to offer higher rates to attract new buyers for the bonds It could also affect global markets as US treasuries are considered one of the safest investments idk about that as of right now

FYI bonds is basically when a country needs funds for whatever reason schools building roads etc it borrows money from people or this case a country They get the money upfront and then they return it later with a little extra as interest for letting them borrow

Aight this just means China speculative is putting less money or lending less money to the US as of right now which leads to whats happening currently yields are going up this is like the interest rate you earn on bonds When lots of people buy bonds their price goes up and the yield interest rate goes down even though stock markets are going down Normally youd expect the yield to go down when the market crashes because people would be buying bonds for safety But if the yield is going up while the stock market down it suggests that people are losing confidence in US treasury bonds causing the US would struggle to borrow money interest rates could skyrocket and it would likely make the economy much worse than during the  financial crisis

 Trade imbalances Without tariffs wealthier nations with more efficient industries could flood markets in weaker economies worsening inequality and dependence

"Tariffs pull money out of circulationthey are by definition a deflationary financial tool

As for your second point your cost analysis is wrong but Ill get to that in a second When theres no demand supply builds up Prices then fall until the excess inventory starts moving Manufacturers seeing the decline in demand reduce supply so it aligns with the new reality Right now companies are still ordering based on pretariff demand which means were going to see an oversupply Products will sit on shelves prices will fall and companies will sell at a loss if necessarybecause recovering  is better than 

Over the past  years people bought into the idea that profits only go up That worked because demand wasnt being priced out People still buy Starbucks despite a  price increase in the last decade Companies raise prices until demand drops Thats why food groceries and luxury goods have become so expensive But lets be clearStarbucks could still sell a coffee for under  and profit Yes theres a lower limit to how far prices can fall but its far below what weve seen in recent years And when the money supply contracts the dollar strengthens meaning your money goes furtherdriving prices down even more

So why is this a problem Because falling prices mean shrinking profits Companies cut costs to compensate which means layoffs People lose jobs homes and spending power That further reduces demand and increases unemployment creating a downward spiral

Anyone saying tariffs will raise prices in the long run doesnt understand economics Shortterm while employment is still stable prices might spike But give it six monthseverything will change If these tariffs persist that long the bigger threat is global we risk unseating the US dollar as the worlds reserve currency As the dollar strengthens other currencies weakenunless those countries also deflate their currency which they cant match at the same scale Their only move is to stop trading in dollars which is where the US gets its power

Fourth there are a ton of side effects People are going to lose their jobs those people that lose their jobs are going to stop buying things if people stop buying things then companies will start to go out of business if companies go out of business then even more people will start losing their jobs and it can create a feedback loop that gets worse and worse and considering the general incompetence of this administration people dont have confidence in this administration to deal with that kind of crisis

Fifth there are also all of the things being lost in terms of foreign relations Countries are making moves to drop the US as the worlds reserve currency or at the very least to reduce their dependence on it If that happens the US debt problem which was already very bad to start with is going to get even worse which can cause a lot of really bad things to happen in the future and theyre trying to get ahead of that Not to mention other problems like boycotts against US products in other countries and people refusing to travel to the USA etc",-0.09374999999999997,254,Other
