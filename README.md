This repository is for our 7th semester minor project titled **Advanced Stock Price Forecasting Using a Hybrid Model of Numerical and Textual 
Analysis**.

## Current Progress

For our project, Advanced Stock Price Forecasting Using a Hybrid Model of Numerical and Textual 
Analysis, we have made substantial progress across different areas. Currently, we are analyzing 
relevant research papers and exploring the most suitable dataset for our needs. Since the project 
involves time-series data, we are learning to use Influx Db for efficient data storage, which will allow us to 
handle large-scale time-series data effectively.

In addition to numerical analysis, we are focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the 
textual analysis of financial news and reports. We are evaluating tools like NLTK (Natural Language 
Toolkit) and spaCy to extract relevant insights from textual data, which will be integrated into our hybrid 
forecasting model to enhance prediction accuracy.

We are also learning to use Grafana for data visualization and real-time dashboard creation, which will be 
applied in the later stages of the project to display the forecasting results in a clear and dynamic manner.
To facilitate collaboration, we have set up a GitHub repository and on boarded all team members, 
ensuring effective version control and seamless project management. Tasks and tools have been 
distributed among team members for a more focused and efficient workflow.

Lastly, we are studying advanced machine learning algorithms, including ARIMA, LSTM, and 
Transformer models, which will be key to the predictive analysis component of the project. These 
models will be combined with the textual analysis to form a comprehensive hybrid model.

We are currently analyzing stock dataset of different companies like Apple, Google, TCS, etc
